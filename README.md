# 📊 Census Data Analysis using Python 🧠

This project analyzes census data using Python and Pandas to generate 20 meaningful insights about the population.
It focuses on demographics, employment, education, income, taxation, and citizenship-related trends.

---

## 🚀 Overview

The goal of this project is to explore real-world census data and extract key patterns such as:

* How many people will become senior citizens in the coming years
* Number of new voters likely to be added
* Gender and education-based income variations
* Contribution of non-citizens to the economy
* Employment and pension projections
* Taxpayer category-wise total income

This analysis gives a comprehensive understanding of a population’s socio-economic behavior.

## 🧾 Dataset Requirements

The dataset must be a CSV file named `census.csv`.
It should contain the following columns:

* Age
* Gender
* Marital Status
* Weeks Worked
* Parents Status
* Citizen Ship
* Income
* Education
* Taxfilter status

Each column represents personal, educational, or economic details of individuals.

## 📈 Analyses Performed

1. **Senior Citizens in next X years** — Finds how many people will turn 60 and become senior citizens soon.
2. **New Voters in next X years** — Calculates how many people will turn 18 and become eligible voters.
3. **Employable Female Widows or Divorced** — Identifies widowed or divorced females who are currently working.
4. **Orphans by Parents Status** — Counts how many individuals are orphans or have absent parents.
5. **Pension Additions after X years** — Estimates how many citizens will become pension-eligible.
6. **Gender-wise Per Capita Income** — Calculates average income per person for each gender.
7. **Overall Per Capita Income** — Displays the overall average income of the entire dataset.
8. **Total Tax to be Collected (10%)** — Calculates total tax assuming a flat 10% income tax.
9. **Income by Tax Payer Type** — Shows total income grouped by taxpayer category.
10. **Gender-wise Total Income** — Compares total income generated by males and females.
11. **Sex Ratio** — Calculates the ratio of male to female population.
12. **Education vs Employment** — Analyzes how employment varies across education levels.
13. **Education and Gender Count** — Displays how education levels differ by gender.
14. **Widow Female Count** — Finds the total number of widowed females.
15. **Parents Status and Gender Count** — Shows how many males and females have or lack parents.
16. **Citizens aged above 60 by Citizenship** — Groups senior citizens by their citizenship type.
17. **Employable Widows and Divorced (All Genders)** — Finds widowed or divorced individuals of all genders who are working.
18. **Non-citizens Working Percentage** — Calculates the percentage of non-citizens who are employed.
19. **Money Generated by Non-citizens** — Displays the total income earned by non-citizens.
20. **Unemployed Doctorate Holders above Age 23** — Lists highly educated people (doctorates) who are unemployed.

## 💡 Example Results

Here’s an example of what you might see when the script runs:

* Senior citizens in next 5 years: 245
* New voters in next 5 years: 1,210
* Average per capita income: 48,320.56
* Total tax (10%): 12,350,000
* Non-citizens working percentage: 67.45%

These results will vary based on your dataset.
